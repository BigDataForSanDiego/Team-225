### 2024 BIG DATA HACKATHON PROPOSAL FORM

#### Team Number: `Team 225' 

#### Team Name: `SRCAG Bears`    
  
#### Your team’s hackathon idea in One sentence:
##### `Who (Stakeholder): Hospitals and non profits. These are the places that distribute the Narcan to the community.

Problem:
There is a certain supply of Narcan in San Diego County, with a certain demand as well 
There is a current growing problem of fentanyl usage and overdoses, which are almost always fatal, due to our proximity to the border
There is a lack of awareness surrounding the overall effectiveness of Narcan (75% to 100% effective when used correctly,) which could save numerous lives 

So what: 
Reduce the # of deaths in San Diego County among youth, unhoused individuals, and other demographics
Help hospitals, nonprofits, and other agencies optimize limited resources

In our Presentation:
Regression model that can predict the most optimal distribution of Narcan by Zip Code/general location
Regression model that can predict the rise in fentanyl use and death over 5-10 years
Model displayed in map form, where the stakeholder can interact with the map to view exact Qs of Narcan per zip code in San Diego County`

#### Hackathon Five CORE Themes. `CHECK ONE or TWO QUESTIONS (insert X in [ ])`.
- [X] Access to care
> How can we make it easier to access care (especially specialists) and provide clear, timely notifications, and reminders along their healthcare journey?
- [ ] Patient satisfaction
> How can we make it more convenient for patients to provide real-time feedback about their healthcare experience through a mobile app?
- [ ] New patient experience
> As a potential new customer, how can we leverage the mobile app to help new patients better understand what services are available to them?
- [ ] Managing my health
> It’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the tasks patients often have to do to maintain their health, how can we make managing health more enjoyable?
- [ ] Addressing mental health challenges
> Mental health challenges may be difficult to identify and have a broad impact on health, how can we help clinicians be more in tune with patients mental health needs?

#### Optional Questions. `TEAMS CAN SELECT ONE ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL QUESTION (insert X in [ ])`
- [ ] Cultural Competence in Healthcare
> How can we design a mobile app that helps healthcare providers better understand and respect cultural differences, improving communication and care for diverse patient populations?
- [ ] Access to Care for Rural and Remote Communities
> How can we leverage technology to improve healthcare access for rural and remote communities, ensuring timely and specialized care for those in underserved areas? (Focus on SDSU Imperial Valley Connection - Rural/Remote)
- [ ] Enhancing disease prevention (For Geocomputational Thinker Awards)
> How can big (geospatial) data analytics and AI be used to improve access to information about the influence of human behavior, cultural practices, and social interactions on the spread of diseases?
- [X] Addressing environmental health disparities (For Geocomputational Thinker Awards)
> How can we leverage big (geospatial) data analytics and AI to improve access to resources that mitigate the impact of environmental factors, i.e. pollution, on health disparities?
